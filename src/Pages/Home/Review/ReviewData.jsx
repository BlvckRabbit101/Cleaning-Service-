The cleaning technician exhibited a high level of expertise and dedication, successfully eliminating stubborn stains that had accumulated over the years. Not only was he thorough in his work, but his politeness and respectfulness throughout the process made the entire experience exceptionally positive.'

The Cleaner attended on time and did an excellent job including making the oven, dishwasher and fridge/freezer look as good as new. I was very satisfied with the service provided, would use again and can highly recommend as a reliable and professional company.'

       text: "We were very reluctant to trust strangers in our home, although as this was a cleaning company we decided to take a chance. Over a short period of time, we had two different cleaners, and because no one knows your home like yourself it became evident corners were being cut. Therefore we decided a cleaner wasn't for us and if you want something done properly then you have to do it yourself !!"

Very quick to respond to my emails, easy communication all along, huge help with follow up correspondence with the real estate agent (special mention to Katie who is excellent!) and excellent level of cleaning. I am genuinely demanding and found their service to be stellar'

The operative arrived on time. He was helpful in moving the carpet. Furthermore, he did an excellent job in a short time. I paid on the day, which was very convenient for me. The carpet has come up like new! Don’t pay exhorbitant up-front amounts go with this company.'
